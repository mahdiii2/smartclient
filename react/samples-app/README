Using the React Showcase Samples Project

You can rebuild/repack the React JSX samples featured in the Showcase using this
project.  To do so, first create the proper softlinks to the SmartClient runtime,
React source, and webpacked output with

    npm run links

then install the required project dependencies via

    npm install

 make the desired edits to the sample JSX source under

    isomorphic/system/reactSamples/source/ 

and finally, invoke

    npm run tryit

to have webpack rebuild the output directory isomorphic/system/reactSamples/build/
and start monitoring it for future changes, so that it rebuilds the transpiled JS
output loaded automatically by the Showcase.  Alternatively, to just rebuild the
output directory in production mode in one shot and exit, use

    npm run build
