CVS: ** Please visit http://wiki.isomorphic.com/cvsCommitTemplate for detailed
CVS:     instructions on how to populate this template **
CVS: We use this information to automatically assemble public change-log files
CVS: so it is important developers use the template correctly.
CVS: Reminders:
CVS: - "Public Notes" and "Back Compatibility Notes" are made public as part of a change log with each release
CVS: - Each section should be populated *below* the header line
CVS: - SC vs SGWT - only populate this if your change effects *only* one product line
