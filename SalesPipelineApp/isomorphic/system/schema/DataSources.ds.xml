<!-- 
This DataSource is the special "DataSource DataSource".  It defines the schema by which other 
XML DataSources are loaded, and it is itself a DataSource.  Because it would be the schema *for
itself*, it has to be written assuming schemaless transform.

In W3C XML Schema this bootstrap problem is solved by using the older DTD schema language to define
the schema for the XML Schema language.  

Also part of this bootstrap are the subobjects of DataSources:
DataSourceField.ds.xml
Validator.ds.xml

<Object ID="DataSources"	Constructor="DataSource" __autoConstruct="DataSource"
        addGlobalId="false">
    <fields>
        <loadID type="string" xmlAttribute="true" />
    </fields>
</Object>
